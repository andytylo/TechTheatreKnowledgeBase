Meeting 1 – DIRECTOR'S ANALYSIS AND FIRST THOUGHTS – week 0

The expectation for this meeting is that all designers have thoroughly read/listened to the materials (script, libretto, score, recordings as applicable), are familiar with the dramaturgical baseline of the piece, and come ready to talk and ask questions about the show. At this meeting, the director will share his/her detailed analysis of the piece, identify major themes, and highlight their personal resonances with the text/music. For the designers, a list of questions for the director is expected, as well as concrete thoughts about the piece's structure, themes, and meaning.
